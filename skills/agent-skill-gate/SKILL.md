  MANDATORY before code changes, debugging, planning, or multi-step implementation in ANY

  the task, then use tools. Hooks block mutating tools until at least one catalog skill was
  Read. Works without superpowers or other plugins.

# Agent Skill Gate

## When this applies

Every Grok Composer session where you might call `grep`, `Read` (for implementation context),
`Write`, `StrReplace`, `Shell` (mutating), or delegate `task()` for implementation.

## Workflow

1. Trust the skill catalog from `grok inspect` or SessionStart hook state.
2. For the user's request, list which catalog skills plausibly apply (by description).
3. **`Read` each applicable skill file** before other tools.
4. Say `Using <name> to <purpose>` for each skill loaded.
5. Only then run mutating or broad search tools.

## Hook enforcement

The **oh-my-grok** plugin (`grok plugin install github:mihazs/oh-my-grok --trust`) registers
hooks via `hooks/hooks.json`. They deny mutating tools when the catalog is non-empty and
no skill was Read yet. Satisfy the gate by Reading any applicable catalog entry, or this
meta-skill file (path from `grok inspect`).
