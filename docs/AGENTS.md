## Model behavior

All agents default to `model: inherit`, meaning they use the parent session's model. To assign specific models, configure them in your Grok configuration. Do not hard-code model names that may not exist in the user's catalog.

## Subagent depth

Grok supports only one level of subagent depth. Sisyphus and Atlas spawn leaf specialists directly. Leaf agents never receive `spawn_subagent` capability.
