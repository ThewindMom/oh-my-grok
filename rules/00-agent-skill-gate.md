# Agent Skill Gate (Grok Composer)

Applies to **Grok Composer** in any workspace. Does not govern OpenCode, Cursor, or Claude Code delegation APIs.

## Source of truth

Run `grok inspect` (or rely on SessionStart hook cache at `~/.grok/state/skill-gate/<session>/all-skills.json`). The catalog lists every skill Grok discovered: project, user, and plugin scopes.

## Before mutating tools

1. Identify skills whose **description** matches the user task.
2. **`Read` each applicable `SKILL.md`** using the path from inspect (absolute paths in catalog).
3. Announce one line per skill: `Using <name> to <purpose>`.
4. Hooks block `Write`, `StrReplace`, `EditNotebook`, and `Delete` until at least one catalog skill was `Read` this session (when the catalog is non-empty).

Read-only work (questions, diagnostics, review without edits) should still load skills when descriptions match; for pure explanation with no file changes, reading the meta-skill `agent-skill-gate` once satisfies the hook minimum.

## Any installed skill

- **Project** skills under `.agents/skills/` or `.grok/skills/` in the workspace
- **User** skills under `~/.grok/skills/` (other tools; not oh-my-grok duplicates)
- **Plugin** skills from installed Grok plugins (oh-my-grok, superpowers, etc.)

Do not hardcode skill names. Use the catalog.

## Subagents (`task()`)

Grok has no `load_skills`. Paste relevant skill **paths** and summaries from the catalog into the subagent `prompt`.

## Fail-open

If `grok inspect` fails or returns an empty skill list, hooks allow mutating tools after you `Read` the oh-my-grok `agent-skill-gate` skill from the plugin path in inspect.

## Meta-skill

Full hook behavior: oh-my-grok plugin `skills/agent-skill-gate/SKILL.md` (see `grok inspect`).
